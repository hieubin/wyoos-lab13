# Build Process and Bug Fixes

## Initial Build Issue

When attempting to build the project with `make`, encountered a Makefile syntax error:

```
as --32 -o interrupts_asm.o $
Assembler messages:
Error: can't open $ for reading: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:14: interrupts_asm.o] Error 1
```

### Root Cause
The Makefile had incomplete variable references using `$` instead of `$<` on lines 8, 11, and 14.

### Fix Applied
Updated Makefile rules to use proper Make automatic variables:
- Line 8: `g++ $(GPPPARAMS) -o $@ -c $` → `g++ $(GPPPARAMS) -o $@ -c $<`
- Line 11: `as $(ASPARAMS) -o $@ $` → `as $(ASPARAMS) -o $@ $<`
- Line 14: `as $(ASPARAMS) -o $@ $` → `as $(ASPARAMS) -o $@ $<`

## Second Build Issue - Static Function Access

After fixing the Makefile, encountered C++ compilation errors:

```
src/interrupts.cpp: In static member function 'static uint32_t InterruptManager::HandleInterrupt(uint8_t, uint32_t)':
src/interrupts.cpp:82:8: error: invalid use of member 'InterruptManager::hardwareInterruptOffset' in static member function
```

### Root Cause
The static function `HandleInterrupt` was trying to access non-static member variables and functions directly.

### Fix Applied
1. **Added static pointer initialization**: Added `InterruptManager* InterruptManager::ActiveInterruptManager = 0;` to track the active instance.

2. **Set active instance in constructor**: Added `ActiveInterruptManager = this;` in the constructor.

3. **Updated HandleInterrupt function**: Modified to use the active instance pointer:
   ```cpp
   uint32_t InterruptManager::HandleInterrupt(uint8_t interrupt, uint32_t esp)
   {
       if(ActiveInterruptManager != 0)
       {
           if(ActiveInterruptManager->hardwareInterruptOffset <= interrupt && 
              interrupt < ActiveInterruptManager->hardwareInterruptOffset+16)
           {
               if(interrupt == ActiveInterruptManager->hardwareInterruptOffset + 1)
               {
                   ActiveInterruptManager->HandleKeyboardInterrupt();
               }
               
               ActiveInterruptManager->programmableInterruptControllerMasterCommandPort.Write(0x20);
               if(ActiveInterruptManager->hardwareInterruptOffset + 8 <= interrupt)
                   ActiveInterruptManager->programmableInterruptControllerSlaveCommandPort.Write(0x20);
           }
       }
       
       return esp;
   }
   ```

## Third Build Issue - Missing Function Declaration

Final compilation error:

```
src/keyboard.cpp:56:17: error: 'SolveQuadraticEquation' was not declared in this scope
```

### Root Cause
The `SolveQuadraticEquation()` function was defined in keyboard.cpp but not declared before its use.

### Fix Applied
Added function declaration at the top of keyboard.cpp:
```cpp
void SolveQuadraticEquation();
```

## New Feature Added - Quit Functionality

### Problem
User reported being unable to exit the OS when running in VirtualBox (unlike QEMU which supports Ctrl+Alt+G).

### Solution Implemented
Added a quit feature that responds to 'q' or 'Q' key press:

1. **Modified ProcessKeyboardInput function** to handle quit:
   ```cpp
   if(key == 'q' || key == 'Q')
   {
       printf("\nShutting down...\n");
       asm("cli");  // Disable interrupts
       asm("hlt");  // Halt processor
       while(1);    // Infinite loop as safety
   }
   ```

2. **Updated startup message** to inform users:
   ```
   QUADRATIC EQUATION SOLVER
   ax^2 + bx + c = 0
   Press 'q' to quit
   ```

## Build Optimization - .gitignore

### Problem
Build process generates temporary files that shouldn't be tracked in version control.

### Solution
Created `.gitignore` file to exclude:
- Object files (`*.o`)
- Binary files (`*.bin`) 
- ISO files (`*.iso`)
- Temporary build directory (`iso/`)

## Final Build Success

After all fixes, the project builds successfully:
```bash
make clean && make mykernel.iso
```

The resulting `mykernel.iso` can be run in both QEMU and VirtualBox, with the new quit functionality allowing clean exit from VirtualBox.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Fixed Makefile syntax** - Corrected variable references
2. **Fixed static function access** - Implemented singleton pattern for InterruptManager
3. **Fixed missing declaration** - Added function prototype
4. **Added quit feature** - Implemented 'q' key shutdown
5. **Added build hygiene** - Created .gitignore for build artifacts

All changes maintain the original functionality while adding the requested exit capability and ensuring clean builds.
